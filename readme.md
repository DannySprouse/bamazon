This app does not work.

It loads the table and pulls the items from the database as seen in First Screen. (See firstscreen.jpg)

After selecting item and quantity, it returns the total price.  (See secondscreen.jpg)

Then it freezes there and will not display the table again with the updated inventory.  Clearly I'm doing something wrong in customer.js file.

This is not added to my final portfolio for obvious reasons!
