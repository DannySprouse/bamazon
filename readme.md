This app does not work.

It loads the table and pulls the items from the database as seen in First Screen.

After selecting item and quantity, it returns the total price.

Then it freezes there and will not display the table again with the updated inventory.  Clearly I'm doing something wrong in customer.js file.

First Screen:  ![Screen shot after entering node customer.js](firstscreen.jpg?raw=true "First Screen")

Second Screen: ![Screen shot after entering item ID and qty](secondscreen.jpg?raw=true "Second Screen")
